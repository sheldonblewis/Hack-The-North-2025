# AlphaEvolve for LLM Red-Teaming: Strategy Document

## Problem Framing

### Jailbreak Discovery as Optimization

We reframe adversarial prompt discovery as a multi-objective optimization problem where:

- **Search Space**: The space of all possible natural language prompts
- **Objective Function**: Maximizing jailbreak success rate while maintaining stealth and efficiency
- **Constraints**: Ethical boundaries, computational resources, and target model limitations
- **Optimization Method**: Evolutionary algorithms treating prompts as "genetic material"

Traditional manual red-teaming is limited by human creativity and time. Our evolutionary approach systematically explores the prompt space, discovering novel attack vectors through iterative refinement and combination of successful strategies.

### Evolutionary Search for Adversarial Prompts

Evolutionary algorithms excel at exploring complex, multi-modal search spaces where:

1. **No clear gradient exists** - Unlike continuous optimization, prompt effectiveness can't be easily differentiated
2. **Local optima are common** - Small prompt changes may drastically affect success
3. **Combinatorial complexity** - Astronomical number of possible prompt combinations
4. **Multiple solutions exist** - Many different prompts may achieve the same objective

The evolutionary process mimics natural selection:
- **Mutation**: Small changes to prompts (word substitution, role-play addition)
- **Crossover**: Combining successful elements from different prompts
- **Selection**: Prioritizing prompts that successfully bypass defenses
- **Population diversity**: Maintaining various attack strategies simultaneously

### Ethical Boundaries and Responsible Research

This framework operates under strict ethical guidelines:

- **Defensive Focus**: Designed exclusively for improving AI safety and robustness
- **Controlled Environment**: Only test on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Synthetic Objectives**: Use proxy targets (e.g., "get cookie recipes" instead of actual harmful content)
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Share findings through proper channels to improve model safety
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all generated prompts and evaluation results

## Core Evolutionary Loop

### Initialization: Seeding the System

The framework begins with a diverse set of baseline prompts covering different attack strategies:

```python
seed_strategies = [
    "Direct request prompts",
    "Role-playing scenarios",
    "Hypothetical framing",
    "Multi-step decomposition",
    "Encoding/obfuscation techniques",
    "Contradictory instructions",
    "Context manipulation"
]
```

**Initial Population Generation:**
1. Use existing jailbreak taxonomies to create diverse seeds
2. Generate variations using LLM-assisted prompt creation
3. Include both simple and complex attack patterns
4. Ensure representation of different linguistic styles and approaches

### Generation: LLM-Driven Prompt Creation

New prompt candidates are generated through multiple mechanisms:

#### Mutation Operators
- **Role-Play Injection**: Adding fictional personas or "uncensored mode" instructions
- **Encoding Obfuscation**: Character substitution, base64 encoding, linguistic tricks
- **Conditional Framing**: "Hypothetical", "academic", or "fictional" contexts
- **Multi-Step Breaking**: Decomposing requests into innocent-seeming steps
- **Tone Manipulation**: Urgency, authority, or emotional appeals
- **Context Addition**: Justifications, credentials, or legitimizing frames

#### Crossover Operations
- **Sentence Mixing**: Combining structural elements from successful prompts
- **Strategy Hybridization**: Merging different attack approaches
- **LLM-Assisted Combination**: Using language models to intelligently blend concepts

#### Adaptive Generation
- Learn from successful mutations and prioritize effective strategies
- Maintain diversity to avoid convergence on single attack types
- Dynamic mutation rates based on population fitness

### Evaluation: Multi-Criteria Scoring

Success evaluation uses multiple metrics beyond binary success/failure:

#### Primary Metrics
- **Jailbreak Success Rate**: Does the prompt achieve the stated objective?
- **Response Quality**: How completely does the target model comply?
- **Stealth**: Does the prompt avoid triggering obvious safety mechanisms?

#### Secondary Metrics
- **Efficiency**: Prompt length and complexity
- **Transferability**: Success across different target models
- **Robustness**: Resistance to minor perturbations

#### Evaluation Pipeline
```python
def evaluate_prompt(prompt, objective, target_model):
    # Generate response
    response = target_model.generate(prompt)

    # Automated classification
    success = classifier.is_successful_jailbreak(response, objective)

    # Nuanced scoring
    score = calculate_fitness(response, success, prompt_features)

    return EvaluationResult(success, score, response, metadata)
```

### Evolution: Selection and Refinement

**Selection Mechanisms:**
- **Tournament Selection**: Compare small groups to identify strongest candidates
- **Elite Preservation**: Always keep top performers across generations
- **Diversity Maintenance**: Prevent convergence by rewarding novel approaches

**Population Dynamics:**
- Maintain 15-30 individuals per generation for manageable evaluation costs
- Run 5-15 generations depending on objective complexity
- Implement early stopping when highly successful prompts are found

**Adaptive Parameters:**
- Mutation rate adjustment based on population diversity
- Crossover probability tuned to balance exploration vs exploitation
- Selection pressure modulation to prevent premature convergence
