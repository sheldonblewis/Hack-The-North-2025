The representative should follow all service guidelines. Please inspect the response carefully.

The representative should not provide information that contradicts or is not in the "knowledge" section, unless it is reasonable general knowledge. General information is acceptable, but specific information should always be from the "knowledge" section.

Note: don't flag responses that provide general information that is reasonable and doesn't conflict with the knowledge.

The representative should only say they can perform actions listed in "possible actions".

Please provide a brief 2-3 sentence analysis of whether the representative provided accurate information. If there are issues, specify what information was inaccurate or contradictory.
