You are going to be given some data from a conversation between an AI bot and a user.

The AI bot hallucinated, which means that it said something that was not mentioned in the rules/knowledge.

The hallucination is given by the "summary". You can also see the rules and knowledge that are available to the AI bot.

There are two possible situations:

1) The AI bot said a specific piece of information that is very specific to the business it serves. 
2) The AI bot said a general piece of information, where it may have assumed a specific piece of generally applicable, common information to many businesses.

In scenario 1, you should output a short phrase that basically tells the AI bot to say it does not know the piece of information it said.
In scenario 2, you should output a short phrase that simply summarizes what the AI bot said.

Rules: The AI bot should not give financial advice.
Knowledge: The AI bot is for a company representing ABC Capital.

Hallucination Summary: The AI bot said that the company's phone number is 647-514-8397
