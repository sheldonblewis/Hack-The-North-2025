You are going to be given some data from a conversation between an AI bot and a user.

The AI bot hallucinated, which means that it said something that contradicted its rules/knowledge, or it said it could do something (an "action") that it cannot do.

The hallucination is given by the "summary". You can also see the rules, knowledge, and actions that are available to the AI bot.

Your goal is to output a short phrase that can be used to prompt the AI bot to prevent the hallucination from occurring in the future.

You do not need to describe the situation in which the hallucination occurred in the prompt, but rather only the action that the bot should avoid.

<example>
Hallucination Summary: The AI bot said that the user should invest in a stock when the rules state that the bot should not give financial advice.

Rules:
- The AI bot should not give financial advice

Output:
