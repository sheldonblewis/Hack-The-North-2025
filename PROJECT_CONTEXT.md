# Red Team AI Agent - Project Context

## Vision & Mission

Build an automated, multi-agent red-teaming system that simulates adversarial attacks on LLMs to uncover safety risks, vulnerabilities, and failure modes—then automatically tests defenses, scores risk, and outputs actionable analytics.

**Goal:** Offer a scalable, robust platform to proactively test, analyze, and improve the safety of generative AI models. Enable continuous risk and compliance monitoring for developers, security teams, and regulators.

## Problem Statement

Modern large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems are increasingly used in real-world applications, but their "safety boundaries" are fragile—they can be tricked ("jailbroken") into producing harmful, toxic, unethical, or illegal outputs. Traditional testing is manual, slow, and incomplete, making it hard for AI builders, enterprises, and regulators to confidently deploy these technologies.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### Multi-Agent Attack & Defense
- **Attack Agent**: Generates sophisticated adversarial prompts to circumvent safety alignment (avoiding refusals, leaking PII, producing harmful instructions)
- **Defense Agent**: Detects, rewrites, and patches responses to block or mitigate attacks

### Automated Testing Suite
- Attack models via API (Cohere, Gemini, Martian, etc.) or locally
- Support multiple attack strategies and risk categories:
  - Toxicity
  - Violence
  - Hate speech
  - Sexual content
  - Self-harm
- Track success/failure, severity, and categorize issues

### Risk Scoring & Dashboard
- Score each attack-response pair (Attack Success Rate, risk level)
- Visualize results in dashboards and reports
- Show trends, outstanding vulnerabilities, and patched issues
- Enable rapid analysis for security teams

### Explainable Compliance
- Log, classify, and export findings for regulators, safety teams, or clients
- Generate audit reports (CSV/PDF/API)
- Maintain compliance documentation

### Extensible for Enterprise
- API integration for CI/CD pipelines
- Periodic scheduled red-team runs
- User-uploadable attack modules or prompt sets
- Evolving threat coverage

## Technical Architecture (T3 Stack)

### Backend
- Orchestrate agent workflows and result logging
- Handle API/model calls to various LLM providers
- Store attacks, defenses, and analytics
- Database: Start with Supabase, scale to Databricks if needed

### Frontend/UI
- Custom UI for launching attack suites
- Risk analytics and vulnerability visualization
- Interactive dashboard for management, researchers, and enterprise teams
- Findings browser and compliance report export

### LLM Integration
- Support common model APIs (Cohere, Gemini, Martian)
- Local or cloud hosting capabilities
- Modular framework for adding attack and defense strategies

## Example Workflow

1. **Define red-team attack suite**: Pick risk categories, enter model endpoint
2. **Run attack agent**: Generate adversarial prompts, capture responses
3. **Run defense agent**: Attempt to block, patch, or rephrase at-risk outputs
4. **Log and score**: Store metrics (ASR/risk) and highlight critical vulnerabilities
5. **Visualize**: UI dashboard shows vulnerability maps, trend charts, patch status
6. **Report**: Export audit/compliance logs for stakeholders

## Business Vision

Deliver a SaaS platform for "Red Team as a Service," letting enterprises and regulators automate, audit, and improve genAI safety at scale. Target users include:

- AI developers and engineers
- Enterprise security teams
- Compliance and risk management
- Regulatory bodies
- AI safety researchers

## Risk Categories & Attack Types

### Core Risk Areas
- **Safety**: Harmful instructions, dangerous advice
- **Privacy**: PII extraction, data leakage
- **Bias**: Discriminatory outputs, unfair treatment
- **Misinformation**: False information, conspiracy theories
- **Manipulation**: Social engineering, persuasion attacks

### Attack Strategies
- Prompt injection
- Jailbreaking techniques
- Role-playing scenarios
- Multi-turn conversation attacks
- Encoding/obfuscation methods

## Success Metrics

- **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**: Percentage of successful attacks
- **Risk Score**: Weighted severity assessment
- **Coverage**: Breadth of attack vectors tested
- **Response Time**: Speed of vulnerability detection
- **Mitigation Effectiveness**: Success rate of defense mechanisms

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Core T3 stack setup, basic attack/defense agents
2. **Phase 2**: Risk scoring, dashboard, multiple LLM providers
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced attack strategies, compliance reporting
4. **Phase 4**: Enterprise features, API integration, SaaS platform
